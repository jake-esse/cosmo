# Landing Page Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Font Sizing
✅ Fixed "Your AI Company" headline to be 160px instead of using Tailwind class

✅ Added proper font weights to DM Sans (400, 500, 700)

### 2. Navigation
✅ Fixed floating nav to not show initially (added mounting check)
✅ Fixed main nav layout to use flexbox instead of absolute positioning
✅ Ensured proper spacing and positioning of logo and Sign Up button

### 3. Typography
✅ Fixed "ABUNDANCE" caption to be uppercase
✅ Applied correct font families (Crimson Text, DM Sans, Roboto Mono)
✅ Ensured all text sizes match Figma specifications

### 4. Layout
✅ Proper max-width containers (1200px)
✅ Correct spacing between sections
✅ Rounded corners on cards (30px radius)

## Known Limitations (Desktop Only for Now)

- No mobile responsiveness yet (waiting for mobile Figma designs)
- No tablet layout (waiting for tablet Figma designs)
- No animations/transitions yet (can add after design approval)

## Component Structure

All components are properly modularized:
- FloatingNav - Sticky navigation on scroll
- MainNav - Top navigation bar
- Hero - Main hero section with 50% overlay
- Benefits - 4-column benefit cards
- HowItWorks - Process steps with green card
- Rewards - Equity rewards grid
- CTASection - Mountain image with call-to-action
- Footer - Footer with links

## Next Steps

1. Test all interactive elements (buttons, links, scroll)
2. Add subtle animations if desired
3. Implement mobile/tablet when designs are ready
4. Optimize images for production
